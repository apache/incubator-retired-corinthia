APACHE Corinthia links to a set of third party libraries, which are not
included in the release, but are needed to build a binary.

These libraries are not part of LICENSE, since they are not part of the
release, and are therefore listed extra in this file:
 
libxml2 (MIT license)
SDL2 (zlib license)
SDL2_image (zlib license)
zlib (zlib license)
